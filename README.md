## Project 2 - My Stockâ€™s Analysis
The second project had us create an mobile application to view companies stocks. The requirements were that the application had to support at least two different mobile Operating Systems and we should use Xamarin to accomplish that. The apps should also use SkiaSharp do draw the graphs and all the information about the stocks should be obtained through an API like https://www.barchart.com/ondemand/freemarket-data-api. To ensure that the application doesn't block while waiting for the information, all API requests are made asynchronously.
